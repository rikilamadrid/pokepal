# AI Interaction Guidelines

PokéPal project rules come first and override the Pathfinder defaults below
where they are more specific.

## PokéPal Project Rules

### Communication

- Be concise and direct; explain non-obvious decisions briefly.
- Ask before large refactors or architectural changes.
- Don't add features not in the approved Feature specs; no "nice to have" extras.
- Never delete files without clarification.
- Make minimal changes; preserve existing patterns; don't refactor unrelated code.

### Git

- One branch per ticket. Orchestrated workers use the engine's
  `ticket/<key>-<slug>` branches; hand-run work uses `feature/<name>` or
  `fix/<name>`.
- Conventional commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `test:`).
- One feature/fix per commit. Never put "Generated with Claude" in commit messages.
- Ask before committing; never commit until `npm run lint` and `npm run build` pass.
- Ask to delete a branch once it is merged.
- Pushing `main` deploys production on Vercel — treat a push to `main` as a
  deployment and ask first.

### PokéPal 2.0 approvals (decided 2026-10-09)

Ask before, in addition to the defaults below:

- any paid model/API call. The recognition evaluation budget is **€5 total**;
  no paid call until a valid API key **and** a confirmed spend-limit mechanism
  exist. Use a cost-efficient vision model first.
- deploying a Supabase Edge Function, or changing Supabase secrets, schema,
  RLS, or Storage on the live project.
- mutating production data, or running a migration against the live database.
- deleting or rewriting any previously saved card photo (local or Supabase
  Storage). Legacy photos are deleted only after their cards are resolved and
  the human approves the migration.
- introducing any recurring paid service (e.g. a paid catalog provider).

Experiments stay isolated from production (local env, fixtures, or a separate
Supabase project). Prefer reversible, non-destructive options that keep the
existing app working.

# Pathfinder Defaults

## Communication

- Be concise, direct, and honest.
- Separate facts, assumptions, recommendations, and unresolved decisions.
- Do not invent answers for `TBD` items.
- After 2–3 grounded failed approaches, stop and explain the blocker.

## Human Approval

Ask before:

- architecture or dependency changes
- database, auth, payment, secrets, or security-sensitive changes
- destructive commands or file deletion
- Git history rewriting
- commits, merges, releases, or deployments
- adopting prototype code into production
- writes outside the repository, such as tickets in a shared store
- adopting any change to Pathfinder's skills, roles, context, or templates that
  a harvest proposed

The human owns judgment, acceptance, merge, and release decisions.

## Git and Delivery

Follow `context/project-overview.md`.

Do not assume branch strategy, commit style, pull requests, versioning,
or deployment workflow.

Inspect current Git state before acting. If the workflow is unclear or
`TBD`, ask.

## Delivery Workflow

Use the workflow skills instead of recreating their procedures in chat:

1. `to-tickets` — slice one approved Feature into executable tickets.
2. `/ticket load` — load one ticket, its Feature, and relevant context.
3. `/ticket start` — implement that ticket.
   Optional before review: `/ticket adversary` challenges the implementation
   through reproducible experiments; Tester independently verifies them.
4. `/ticket review` — verify the work and report findings.
5. `/ticket complete` — complete accepted work and durable records, and name
   the tickets that are now ready.
6. `learn-feature` — optionally teach what was implemented.
7. `reflect` — record friction as it appears, harvest periodically, and let the
   human decide what becomes a Feature.

In human-in-the-loop mode, the human coordinates this loop. In orchestrator
mode, `orchestrate` coordinates the same ticket actions across dependency-safe
workers in separate worktrees. Successful implementation checkpoints Adversary
pending; a separate bounded Adversary session precedes independent Tester.
Suspected defects reach Tester first. Full confirmed findings and experiments
cross sessions through the transient current-ticket checkpoint at the exact PR
head. Repairs rerun Adversary then Tester; unchanged integration-only refresh
requires fresh Tester/CI. Only current-head reviewed work reaches done and the
integrator. One
worker’s human gate does not stop unrelated workers. The execution-mode rule
lives in `skills/ticket/SKILL.md`; neither mode changes human authority.

Lifecycle skills assume their responsible role automatically. Explicit
activation with `/role` is optional and overrides that default for the session.

### Status

Ticket status records durable lifecycle state only:

`Proposed` → `Ready` → `In Progress` → `Complete`

`Cancelled` and `Superseded` are terminal alternatives.

- `Ready` means the human approved execution.
- Review and testing are workflow activity, not a status. Human-in-the-loop
  coordination remains optional; orchestrated delivery requires its separate
  Adversary and Tester phases. A ticket stays `In Progress` until it is complete.
- `Blocked` is not a status. A ticket's blockers are the edges under its
  `## Blocked by`, and anything else that stops work is recorded in current
  workspace state.
- A Feature's status is derived from its tickets, never maintained by hand.
- The human decides approval, acceptance, cancellation, and supersession.

## Context Discipline

- Read only what the current work requires.
- Prefer exact files or sections over broad repository scans.
- Do not load history, roadmap, other tickets, or unrelated context by
  default.
- Work one active ticket per worker. Human-in-the-loop mode uses one ticket
  session; orchestrator mode may coordinate several isolated workers.
- If the work can no longer be understood safely in a focused session,
  stop and split or hand off.
- Extra scaffolding must earn its cost by reducing downstream context.

## Scope Control

Stay inside the approved work.

Do not add unrelated refactors, features, dependency changes, visual
redesigns, speculative abstractions, or later roadmap work.

When necessary work falls outside scope, stop and ask.

## Prototypes

Use `debate-me` to decide whether a prototype is useful.

Use `prototype` to test one important assumption at a time.

Prototype output is evidence, not production code, until the human
explicitly approves adoption.

## Review

Review against the Feature and the actual diff.

Prioritize:

1. correctness
2. security and privacy
3. regressions and edge cases
4. accessibility when relevant
5. performance
6. maintainability

Verification effort should be proportional to risk.

Report findings; do not manufacture them.

## Learning

Explain what was actually implemented.

Use examples, diagrams, or quizzes only when they improve understanding.

Keep Feature learning scoped. Use `learn-codebase` for broad repository
study.
