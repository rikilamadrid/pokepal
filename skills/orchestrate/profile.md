# Execution profiles

Between eligibility and dispatch the orchestrator runs three steps. The
boundaries between them are where a later routing Feature plugs in.

```text
estimate(ticket, in-flight claims)  →  execution profile
select(profile, routing policy)     →  role, model, effort
dispatch(brief)                     →  worker session
```

```sh
node skills/orchestrate/engine/bin/orchestrate.mjs estimate <key> [--risk low|medium|high --reason <text>]
```

## The schema: `pathfinder.execution-profile/1`

```yaml
schema: pathfinder.execution-profile/1
ticket: "53.4"
estimate:
  complexity:
    value: medium
    source: derived
    reason: "5 bullets under ## Changes"
  context:
    value: small
    source: derived
    reason: "3 paths named under ## Context"
  parallel-safety:
    value: isolated
    source: derived
    reason: "no other ticket is in flight"
  risk:
    value: unassessed
    source: derived
    reason: "no risk rule applies"
selection:
  policy: static
  role: developer
  model: inherited
  effort: inherited
```

The schema is closed. An unknown field, an unknown value, a missing field, or
another schema version is refused. A different shape is `/2`, never an edit to
`/1`.

The profile is orchestration state, not ticket content. `claim` writes it
under `## Execution` in the worker's `context/current-ticket.md`. The ticket
body and the ticket template never carry it.

## How each field is derived

Every derived field is a count over the ticket's own body. The same ticket and
the same board give the same bytes.

| Field | Counts | Thresholds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `complexity` | top-level list items under `## Changes` (`-`, `*`, `+`, `1.`, `1)`); indented sub-points belong to their item | ≤3 `low`, ≤7 `medium`, else `high` |
| `context` | distinct backticked paths under `## Context` | ≤3 `small`, ≤8 `medium`, else `large` |
| `parallel-safety` | overlap between this ticket's `Relevant area` paths and those of tickets other workers hold | see below |
| `risk` | the two rules below, or an assessment | see below |

**What counts as a path.** A backticked token with a `/` whose first segment
carries no dot unless it is a dot-directory such as `.github`, or a token ending
in a file extension. URLs, versions and keys (`53.2`, `v1.2.3`), and identifiers
such as `pathfinder.execution-profile/1` are not paths. A leading `./` and a
trailing `/` are dropped. Braces expand, so `src/{a,b}.mjs` is two paths. A glob
is cut back to its literal directory, so `packages/*/test/` is `packages`, and
`**/*.md` names nothing. A path with no extension is read as a directory.

**Relevant area** is the backticked paths on the `- Relevant area:` line and on
bullets nested beneath it. Unbackticked text is not read.

**Parallel safety**, against every registered claim other than this ticket's
whose ticket is not Complete:

- `serialize` — it names a file another in-flight ticket also names
- `shared-surface` — it names a directory containing, contained by, or equal to
  a path another in-flight ticket names
- `isolated` — no overlap, nothing in flight, or no `Relevant area` declared,
  and the reason says which

**Risk** is derived by exactly two rules. `low` applies to complexity `low` with
context `small` and `isolated`. `high` applies to complexity `high` with context
`large`. Anything else is `unassessed`, and the engine does not guess a middle.

The orchestrator may instead assess risk as `low`, `medium`, or `high` with
`--risk` and a non-empty `--reason`. The profile marks that value `assessed`
and keeps the reason. No other field can be assessed.

The thresholds are coarse on purpose. They give a routing policy a stable,
inspectable input, and v1's `static` policy ignores them.

## Routing policies

A policy is one module in `engine/policies/` exporting a synchronous
`select(estimate, { session })`, where `session` is `implementation`, `adversary`, or
`review`. The registry finds policies by file name. A helper a policy imports
is named with a leading underscore, and neither it nor a `*.test.mjs` file is
listed as a policy. A policy receives a deep-frozen copy of the estimate, so a
write to it is refused and cannot alter what the profile records. No scheduler, claim,
status, or brief code names a policy, and a test proves it by adding one.

A project names its policy on an optional second marker line in
`context/execution-mode.md`:

`<!-- pathfinder:routing-policy <name> -->`

No marker means `static`. A name this engine does not ship refuses the claim
and lists the shipped names.

v1 ships `static` alone:

| Session | role | model | effort |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| implementation | `developer` | `inherited` | `inherited` |
| adversary | `adversary` | `inherited` | `inherited` |
| review | `tester` | `inherited` | `inherited` |

`inherited` means whatever the session that dispatches the worker already
runs on. The registry refuses any selection naming a role with no
`roles/<role>.md`, or a model or effort that is not a lower-case name. Model
and effort come from the policy alone. The orchestrator may assess risk, but it
never picks a model.
