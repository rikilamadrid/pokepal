/**
 * The dispatch plan: what one orchestration run would claim now, and why the
 * rest waits.
 *
 * Computed, never acted on. `start` prints it and asks for one approval, and
 * only then claims. The plan is re-derived from the store, the claims, and the
 * routing policy on every call, so re-planning after a completion is the same
 * call, and a plan cannot go stale in memory.
 *
 * Parallelism is never manufactured. Candidates are taken in key order, each
 * estimated against the tickets already in flight *and those already selected
 * in this plan*; one whose parallel safety is `serialize` against either waits
 * for a later round rather than sharing a file with a running worker.
 *
 * Outcomes:
 *
 *   dispatch          at least one ticket would be claimed
 *   nothing-eligible  tickets exist, none can run now; the reasons say why
 *   plan-tickets      the Feature in scope has no tickets: offer to-tickets
 *   plan-features     the store has no tickets at all: to-specs or kickstart
 *
 * The last two never claim, and never plan: they name the planning workflow
 * and stop at its approval gate.
