/**
 * Claiming a ticket: one worktree, one branch, one worker.
 *
 * The claim is `git worktree add .pathfinder/worktrees/<key> -b ticket/<key>-<slug>`
 * from the default branch. It is atomic because git refuses an existing
 * branch and refuses a branch checked out elsewhere; this module refuses
 * earlier and more legibly — a worktree or a `ticket/<key>-*` branch already
 * there, a ticket that is not eligible, a project not in orchestrator mode, a
 * `.pathfinder/` the project does not ignore — so two workers can never own
 * one ticket and a refusal always names its reason.
 *
 * Atomic in Git, not in this process. The first write is the claim ref
 * `refs/pathfinder/claims/<key>`, created only if absent under Git's own ref
 * lock, so of any number of concurrent claims exactly one proceeds. The loser
 * has created nothing. If the winner then fails to add its worktree, it
 * removes exactly what it created — the branch and the ref, and only while
 * they still point where it put them — so a failed claim leaves no trace that
 * would block the next one.
 *
 * Nothing here deletes anything it did not create in this call, and nothing
 * here dispatches. A claim is a place to
 * work, and the worker's `context/current-ticket.md` is seeded so `status`
 * can show the claim before a session has loaded the ticket.
