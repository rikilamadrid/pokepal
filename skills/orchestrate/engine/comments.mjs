/**
 * Every sentence the orchestrator writes to the ticket store, in one place.
 *
 * One spelling each, so the tracker reads the same whichever run, session, or
 * machine wrote it. Every note opens with a marker line naming its event, its
 * ticket, and the facts that make it distinct:
 *
 *     <!-- pathfinder:orchestrate claimed 53.4 ticket/53.4-integration -->
 *
 * The marker is what makes a write idempotent. Before posting, the tracker is
 * read for that exact marker, and a note already there is not posted twice —
 * so a run that dies after writing and is resumed leaves one comment, not two.
 *
 * Notes are append-only history a person reads in order. Lifecycle status
 * stays in the store's own status representation, and nothing here writes it.
