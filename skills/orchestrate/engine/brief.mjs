/**
 * `dispatch(brief)` — the third step. This module builds the brief and says
 * how one harness would honour it; starting the session is the harness's.
 *
 * A brief carries `role`, `model`, and `effort` as first-class fields whatever
 * their values. `inherited` is a value, not an absence. That is what keeps the
 * seam open: a later routing policy changes what goes in those three fields,
 * and nothing about how a brief is built, read, or translated has to move.
 *
 * Translation is where a harness meets the brief, and it has two outcomes
 * only: honoured exactly, or refused by name. A value the harness cannot take
 * is never quietly dropped to `inherited` and never quietly rewritten into
 * something nearby — both would dispatch a different session than the one the
 * policy chose, and say nothing.
