/**
 * `resolve` — record the decision a person made about one entry.
 *
 * This is the one command that rewrites anything, and the rewrite is kept as
 * small as it can be: the target entry's `Status` line, and the resolution
 * field the new status requires. Every other byte of the file — every other
 * entry, this entry's evidence, its occurrences, the header, the blank lines —
 * is the same afterwards. That is not politeness, it is what makes the ledger
 * reviewable: a resolution shows up in a diff as the two or three lines it
 * actually is.
 *
 * Nothing here infers. A closed issue does not make an entry `Applied`, a
 * merged pull request does not make it `Approved`, and no amount of evidence
 * moves a status by itself. A person decides, names the evidence, and this
 * writes down what they decided. The ledger's authority is zero by design, and
 * inference is how a record quietly acquires some.
