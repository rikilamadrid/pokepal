# Where Am I

Answer one question: what is this session working on right now?

Use it when a session resumes, after a long gap, or before deciding the next
action. It reports state. It never changes it.

## Process

1. Role: report an explicit `/role` override when one is active; otherwise
   report `none`. Lifecycle role assumptions apply only to their own invocation,
   so a previous `ticket` or planning action does not persist a role for
   `whereami`. Roles are never written to disk. Do not infer one from the
   current ticket or search `roles/`.
2. Mode: read `context/execution-mode.md` if it exists and take the value from
   its marker line, as `skills/ticket/SKILL.md` §Execution mode defines it.
   Report `human-in-the-loop` when the file is missing, and `invalid` when the
   file exists without a valid marker. Do not infer a mode from anything else.
3. Read `context/current-ticket.md` if it exists.
   Take Ticket, Feature, and Next from it verbatim. The ticket key and the
   Feature number are the ones recorded there, from their filenames.
   If the file is missing or still holds template placeholders, report `none`.
4. Run `git status --short --branch` once.
   Report the branch/ref, and `clean` or the count of changed paths.
5. Compare the Git section of `context/current-ticket.md` with step 4.
   Report a drift line only if the recorded branch differs from the real one.
6. Context telemetry: report it only if this harness exposes it.
   Otherwise `unavailable`. Do not estimate.

## Output

Exactly this shape, one line each:

```
Role:    <role | none>
Mode:    <human-in-the-loop | orchestrator | invalid>
Feature: <## — name | none>
Ticket:  <key and name | none>
Git:     <branch/ref> — <clean | N changed>
Context: <telemetry | unavailable>
Next:    <single next action | none>
```

Add at most one line after it, and only when step 5 found drift:

```
Drift:   current-ticket.md records <branch>, working tree is on <branch>
```

Then stop.

## Rules

- Read only. No writes, no commits, no `git` command that mutates anything.
- Read at most two files: `context/execution-mode.md` and
  `context/current-ticket.md`.
- Do not open the ticket, the feature spec, history, roadmap, or source.
- Report `none`, `unavailable`, or `invalid` instead of inferring a missing
  value.
- Do not offer to fix drift, update state, or start the next action.
  The human decides what happens after the snapshot.

## Example

`/whereami` after resuming mid-feature:

```
Role:    developer
Mode:    human-in-the-loop
Feature: 12 — export saved searches
Ticket:  12.2 — CSV writer
Git:     feature/12-export-saved-searches — 3 changed
Context: unavailable
Next:    Verify the CSV writer against the acceptance criteria
```

## Anti-example

Do not do this:

```
Role:    developer (inferred from recent commits)
Mode:    orchestrator (the project has several branches)
Feature: 12 — export saved searches
Ticket:  12.3 — probably the download endpoint
Git:     feature/12-export-saved-searches — 3 changed
Context: ~60% used
Next:    I can update current-ticket.md and start ticket 12.3 — want me to?
```

It guesses the role from history, guesses the mode from the branch list,
invents a ticket that was never written, estimates telemetry it cannot see, and
turns a status report into a proposal to write state.
