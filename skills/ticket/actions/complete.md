# Ticket: Complete

Invoking this action is the human's acceptance of the ticket. Do not ask for
acceptance again.

The ticket is the one named in the invocation, `/ticket complete <key>`, or,
when none is named, the one `context/current-ticket.md` records. In
`orchestrator` mode a named ticket's worktree is its claim, which
`node skills/orchestrate/engine/bin/orchestrate.mjs owner <key> --json`
reports. That worktree's `context/current-ticket.md` is the file step 6 clears.

## Assumed role

Unless the human explicitly activated a role, assume `developer` for this
invocation: read `roles/developer.md` and follow it. An explicit role overrides
this default. A role narrows responsibility and never grants human authority.

Acceptance of the ticket is not approval of the delivery steps below. Each one
that the project's documented workflow gates is still asked for.

1. Run the project's required final checks.
2. Follow the documented Git, merge, version, release, and deployment workflow.
   Ask for approval where it requires it. If that workflow is undocumented or
   `TBD`, stop and ask rather than choosing one.
3. Mark the ticket `Complete` in the store, closing it where the store has a
   closed state. `skills/ticket/store.md` says how that store is written.
4. Derive the parent Feature's status: when every ticket of that Feature is
   `Complete`, `Cancelled`, or `Superseded`, and at least one is `Complete`, the
   Feature becomes `Complete`. Otherwise leave it exactly as it is. Read the
   sibling tickets' status from the store for this and nothing else. The Feature
   spec is in the repository, and its `## Status` is the only field to write.
5. Add a compact entry to `context/history.md` when the Feature completed at
   step 4. A ticket that leaves its Feature unfinished is an increment, not a
   completed outcome, and the durable record is per Feature.
   Create the file from `templates/history.template.md` if it does not exist.
   `Follow-up` records what remains *of this Feature*; friction about how the
   delivery itself went belongs in the improvement ledger, which no lifecycle
   action reads or writes.
6. Clear or update `context/current-ticket.md`. Do nothing if it does not exist.
7. Report the tickets that are now ready — see Next below — and let the human
   choose. Do not load one.

## Next

A ticket became ready when this completion satisfied its last blocker.

Read the sibling tickets' status and blockers from the store, and report every
ticket whose own status is `Proposed` or `Ready` and whose blockers are now all
`Complete`.

Report each by key and title. When none is ready, say so, and say whether that
is because the Feature is finished or because the remaining tickets are blocked
by something else.

Do not implement the next ticket, and do not decide which one it is.

Do not re-review accepted work unless final verification exposes a new problem.

Do not claim completion if required checks or delivery steps failed.
