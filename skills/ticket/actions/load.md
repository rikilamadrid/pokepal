# Ticket: Load

Prepare one ticket for execution.

## Assumed role

Unless the human explicitly activated a role, assume `developer` for this
invocation: read `roles/developer.md` and follow it. An explicit role overrides
this default. A role narrows responsibility and never grants human authority.

1. Resolve the ticket store. Read `skills/ticket/store.md` and follow it. Then
   read the execution mode as `skills/ticket/SKILL.md` §Execution mode says.
   An invalid file is reported here, once, and the load proceeds as
   `human-in-the-loop`. In `orchestrator` mode, running inside a claim's
   worktree, read `context/tracker.md` and the Feature spec source from the
   main checkout whenever the worktree has no copy. They may be untracked, and
   the main checkout is where they live. The worker brief names it, and
   `node skills/orchestrate/engine/bin/orchestrate.mjs owner <key> --json`
   reports it as `root`.
2. Select the ticket the human named, by key. If none was named, list the ready
   tickets — see Readiness below — and stop.
3. Read the ticket.
4. Read its parent Feature spec, named under the ticket's `## Parent Feature`.
   Read the Feature for its Goal, Requirements, Out of Scope, and Acceptance
   Criteria. Do not read the other tickets of that Feature; the blocker check
   below reads their status and nothing else.
5. Verify every blocker under `## Blocked by`, reading each blocker's status
   from the store:
   - A blocker that is `Complete` is satisfied.
   - A blocker that is `Cancelled` or `Superseded` is not satisfied. Report it
     and stop: an edge pointing at abandoned work is a planning question.
   - Any other status blocks the load. Name the blocking ticket and stop.
   - A named blocker that does not exist blocks the load. Report it by key.
   Stop before writing anything. A blocked load must leave no trace.
6. Read only the files or context the ticket's `## Context` names.
7. Inspect the current Git state. In `orchestrator` mode only, also ask who
   owns the ticket:

   ```sh
   node skills/orchestrate/engine/bin/orchestrate.mjs owner <key> --json
   ```

   If `claim` is not `null` and `here` is `false`, stop before writing
   anything. When `claim.worktree` is set, another worker owns this ticket:
   name its worktree and branch. When it is `null`, the ticket carries a trace
   of earlier work with no live worktree — an orphan branch, a branch checked
   out elsewhere, or an interrupted claim: name `claim.branch` or the claim
   ref, and leave the decision to the human. In `human-in-the-loop` mode this
   step asks nothing of the engine.
8. Stop if a required human decision blocks the work.
9. Record the approval in the ticket's `## Status`:
   - `Proposed` becomes `Ready`. That is the only value this action writes.
   - `Ready` or `In Progress` is left exactly as it is. Reloading a ticket
     mid-work is normal and must not rewrite its state.
   - `Complete`, `Cancelled`, or `Superseded` blocks the load. Report it and
     stop. Reopening terminal work is the human's decision.

   Do this only once steps 1-8 found no blocker, and before the next step, so a
   blocked load never leaves a promoted ticket behind.
10. Create or update `context/current-ticket.md` — it does not ship, so the
    first load writes it — with:
    - ticket key, title, and where it is in the store
    - parent Feature number, name, and spec path
    - execution mode, as read in step 1
    - in `orchestrator` mode, keep the `Worker`, `Worktree`, `Branch`, `State`,
      and `Updated` lines the claim wrote, updating `Updated`
    - Git state
    - blocker, if any
    - next action

    Do not record the lifecycle status here. This file is transient workspace
    state belonging to one session on one machine; the ticket carries the
    durable status.
11. Present a short readiness summary.

## Readiness

A ticket is ready when its own status is `Proposed` or `Ready`, and every ticket
under its `## Blocked by` is `Complete`.

Nothing else makes a ticket ready. File order, ticket number, and the order the
tickets were written are not dependencies.

Do not implement the ticket. That is `/ticket start`.

Do not load the parent Feature's other tickets, unrelated repository areas,
history, or roadmap by default.

Do not rewrite the ticket's substance — its Goal, Context, Changes,
Verification, Out of Scope, or Blocked by. `## Status` is the one field this
action maintains.

Do not copy the ticket into the repository. The store holds it, and
`context/current-ticket.md` records only which ticket this session is on.

Do not edit the parent Feature spec. `load` derives nothing.
