/**
 * The renderer registry: `kind` in, HTML out.

 * checked. An unsupported kind is refused in the structural layer, before
 * anything reaches here.
 *
 * Both entries render into the same shell and inherit the same identity. That
 * is the whole claim of a shared renderer, and it is checkable: nothing below
 * this line knows which kind it is looking at.

 * Render a validated specification.

 * directory listing or a hash table — every list is emitted in the order the
 * specification wrote it.
 *
 * Rendering does not validate and does not pretend to. Called without an
 * attestation — the ordinary case, and the only one available to an outside
 * caller — the artifact carries its provenance rows and no claim to have been
 * checked. Only `deliver()`, which validates first, can supply one.
 *
 * @param {object} spec a specification whose `kind` this engine renders
 * @param {object} [verification] an attestation minted from a passing
 *        validation. Cannot be forged: see `verification.mjs`.
 * @returns {string} a complete, self-contained HTML document
