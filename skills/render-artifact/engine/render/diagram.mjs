 *
 * A diagram artifact is two readings of one set of facts. The canvas is the

 * and every citation. Both are emitted into the document, which is what lets
 * the artifact be read with no scripting at all, and what the interactions in
 * a later ticket will attach to rather than generate.
 *
 * Nothing here decides where anything goes. `layout.mjs` owns geometry,
 * `draw.mjs` owns the markup for it, and this module owns the page around
 * them — which sections exist, what they are called, and in what order. Every
 * word naming a section is renderer interface language; every word inside one
