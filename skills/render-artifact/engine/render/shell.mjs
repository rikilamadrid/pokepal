 * @param {string} parts.lang        BCP 47 tag from the specification, or "en"

 * @param {string} parts.eyebrow     what kind of artifact this is
 * @param {string} [parts.description] meta description
 * @param {string} [parts.style]     a kind's own stylesheet, appended to the
 *        shared theme inside the one `<style>` element. Absent for a kind that
 *        needs none, and then not one byte of the document changes.
 * @param {string} [parts.behavior]  a kind's own inline script, appended to the
 *        shared behaviour inside the one `<script>` element, on the same terms
 *        and for the same reason: a lesson has no graph to traverse, and
 *        shipping it traversal code would put script in an artifact that can
 *        never run it. Absent for a kind that needs none, and then not one
 *        byte of the document changes.
 * @param {string} parts.nav         rendered navigation HTML
 * @param {string} parts.body        rendered lead and content HTML
 * @param {"article"|"explorer"} [parts.layout] which page shape this kind
 *        renders into. Defaults to `article` — the reading column with its
 *        navigation beside it, which is what every kind had before a kind
 *        needed a canvas. `explorer` gives the kind a full-width stage that
 *        fills the first screen, with `parts.body` still rendered into the
 *        same article layout beneath it.
 *
 *        This is deliberately one choice with two values rather than a set of
 *        layout knobs. A kind picks the page shape it needs; it cannot
 *        describe a page shape, and no specification field reaches this.
 * @param {string} [parts.stage]     what fills the explorer's stage. Ignored by
 *        the article layout, and absent for a kind that has no canvas — and
 *        then not one byte of the document changes.
 * @param {object} [parts.source]    the specification's source identity, when
 *        it declares one. A kind describing a system with no repository behind
 *        it has none, and then no provenance row is invented for it.
 * @param {"derived"|"proposed"} [parts.provenance] what kind of claim the
 *        artifact makes, for the kinds that distinguish. Absent for `lesson`.
 * @param {object} [parts.verification] an attestation, when — and only when —
 *        this engine validated the specification and the validation passed
 * @returns {string} a complete HTML document

/**
 * What this artifact claims about itself, and when it is entitled to.
 *
 * The provenance rows are facts copied out of the specification, and only the
 * ones it actually carries. The verification sentence is a claim about work the
 * engine performed, so it appears only against a real attestation — which only
 * `verification.attest()` can mint, and only from a validation that passed.
 *
 * Rendering without one emits no verification language whatsoever. Not a
 * hedge, not "unverified", not a placeholder: an artifact that cannot vouch for
 * itself says nothing on the subject, and the absence of the sentence is the
 * signal. Saying "unverified" would still be the renderer making a claim about
 * a process it did not observe.
 *
 * Even with the attestation, note what the sentences are careful not to say.
 * Each scopes itself to what was checked deterministically and hands the
 * question of whether the page reads well back to a person, because
 * deterministic validation never establishes that and must never be reported as
 * if it did. None of them says the system drawn is correct, and the `derived`
 * one in particular does not: what was verified is that the cited material is
 * there at the cited commit. Provenance, not truth.
 *
 * **Three states, three sentences, and none of them selectable.** There is no
 * field in any specification that chooses between these, softens one, or asks
 * for one it has not earned. The words belong to the renderer for the same
 * reason the claim does — a producer vouching for its own work is precisely
 * what this design exists to make impossible — and they live in the shared
 * shell rather than in a kind renderer because they describe what the *engine*
 * did, which is the same whatever kind rendered into it.
