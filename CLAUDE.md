# Pathfinder Agent Guide

This repository uses Pathfinder’s AI-assisted delivery workflow. Read
`context/execution-mode.md` as `skills/ticket/SKILL.md` defines: human-in-the-loop
or orchestrator, with human-in-the-loop as the default when the file is absent. Project truth lives in `context/`, and reusable behaviors live in `skills/`.

## Read only what is needed

For delivery work, usually read:

1. `context/current-ticket.md`
2. the ticket it names, and that ticket's parent feature spec
3. relevant sections of `context/project-overview.md`
4. relevant rules from `context/coding-standards.md`
5. `context/ai-interaction.md`
6. only the source files needed for the current ticket

Do not load the whole repo by default.

Pathfinder ships two context files: `ai-interaction.md` and
`coding-standards.md`. Everything else in `context/` — `project-overview.md`,
`features/`, `tickets/`, `history.md`, `current-ticket.md`, `handoff.md` — is
written by the workflow that first needs it. A missing file here is normal; skip
it rather than treating it as an error. `tickets/` in particular exists only
when local Markdown is the project's ticket store.

Track the durable ones in Git and ignore the two transient ones,
`current-ticket.md` and `handoff.md`. `context/coding-standards.md` carries the
rule; do not ignore `context/` wholesale.

## Roles

Lifecycle skills assume their responsible role for each invocation and read its
contract themselves: planning uses `planner`, ticket implementation and
completion use `developer`, the optional adversary action uses `adversary`,
and ticket review uses `tester`. Orchestration uses
`orchestrator`; integration uses `integrator`. Each worker implements one active
ticket in its own worktree; roles never call one another directly.

The human can explicitly override that default with `/role <name>`. Read the
named `roles/<name>.md` before anything else and follow it for the session. A
role says what a worker is responsible for, what it reads, and what it must not
do, where a skill says how to perform a task.

A role narrows responsibility and never widens authority. Approval, acceptance,
merge, and release remain the human's whether a role was assumed or explicit.

## Project-selected policies

Follow the stack, architecture, commands, Git workflow, review policy, and release process documented in `context/project-overview.md`.

For contributors working on Pathfinder itself, that file does not exist: this
repository’s Git and release workflow is in `CONTRIBUTING.md` §Git workflow and
§Releasing. This exception applies only to Pathfinder’s own repository; a
destination project records its own choices in `context/project-overview.md`.

If a policy is `TBD`, do not invent it. Ask the human or clearly mark it unresolved.

## Before implementation

Restate:

1. Goal
2. Active ticket
3. Expected files or areas
4. Required context
5. Risks
6. Assumptions
7. Verification plan
8. Out-of-scope work
9. Current Git state
10. Intended Git action under the documented workflow

## Human approval

Ask before actions identified in `context/ai-interaction.md`, especially dependency additions, destructive commands, sensitive migrations, commits, merges, and releases.

## Scope and quality

- Implement only the active feature and current ticket.
- Keep the project stable after each ticket.
- Do not convert prototype code into production code without an explicit feature decision.
- Prefer concrete verification over confident narration.
- Report conflicts between specs, repository reality, and durable context.

## Canonical skills and harness adapters

Canonical Pathfinder skills are tool-neutral and live under `skills/`. Harness-specific representations — `.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/` — are generated integration artifacts and must not become independent behavior contracts. Edit the canonical file; regenerate the adapter.

The Claude Code plugin declared by `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is a third discovery surface, and the only one that generates nothing: it exposes the canonical `skills/` tree itself, namespaced `/pathfinder:<skill>`. There is no plugin copy of any skill and there must never be one. If a discovery surface and its canonical skill disagree, the canonical skill is correct.

An adapter carries the canonical skill's frontmatter and a pointer to it, and nothing else. If an adapter and its canonical skill disagree, the canonical skill is correct.

## Available skills

- `kickstart-pathfinder` — discover and initialize project context
- `debate-me` — pressure-test and recommend product, stack, workflow, and prototype direction
- `reverse-engineer` — analyze an external reference and produce an evidence-based reconstruction blueprint
- `prototype` — create and iterate the cheapest useful validation artifact
- `to-specs` — generate context-sized feature specs
- `to-tickets` — decompose one approved Feature into blocker-linked tickets
- `ticket` — run one action of the ticket delivery loop: `load`, `start`, `adversary`, `review`, `complete`
- `orchestrate` — coordinate several dependency-safe ticket workers at once in orchestrator mode
- `debug-issue` — diagnose an observed failure to its root cause, apply the smallest justified fix, and verify it
- `render-artifact` — compile a typed specification into a deterministic, self-contained visual artifact
- `map-system` — turn a plain request about a system into a semantic diagram artifact
- `learn-feature` — create an interactive lesson for a completed feature
- `learn-codebase` — create a modular learning portal for the repository
- `teach-feature` — teach the verified current feature from its spec, diff, tests, and implementation
- `teach-architecture` — explain how completed features fit into the wider application and system architecture
- `quiz-me` — assess understanding of a recently taught feature with evidence-based questions
- `challenge-me` — create a small transfer exercise applying a learned concept in a changed context
- `learning-review` — review accumulated lessons, identify gaps, and create a reinforcement plan
- `reflect` — review completed work, and the reflection itself, and propose reusable workflow improvements for human approval; `record`, `harvest`, and `resolve` keep them in the improvement ledger
- `handoff` — preserve useful state between sessions or tools
- `role` — explicitly override the role the lifecycle would assume
- `whereami` — report a compact read-only snapshot of the current session
- `skillsmith` — teach and create small local skills
- `hooksmith` — turn a described guarantee into one verified hook for the active harness
- `setup-tracker` — choose the canonical ticket store when it is not local Markdown
- `blog-post-redactor` — turn shipped work into a technical article built only from repository evidence
